code go brrr :D

.py and .csv have to go in the same directory

it's a colon-sv not comma-sv (libre calc was being a butt head)

If it wasn't evident, I don't understand github, so if stuff if messed up I am sorry!

_

If you want it to do more just ask; I can't code but I'll try.

This is for OSRS Clues Scrolls

I made this because I am terrible at anagrams and my NPC name knowledge is bad, but I still wanted to use my brain.

_

I can't find the line anymore, but there was hot-girl-stackexchange stuff going on in the code at one point.
It was ordering a dictionary or something.

Peace love and all that. <3
